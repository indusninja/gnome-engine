List of Todo for GnomeEngine v4.0
=================================

- Comments
  
- The black circle representing the cup is not drawing on the plane when the tile's 
  normal is not along the Y-axis.
  
- Menu buttons for a long menu are not placed correctly as there is too much data 
  to be organized on very limited window space. UPDATE: The problem seems to be less 
  pronounced in full screen mode due to more screen real estate.
  
- Textual description for menus by way of text fields.

- User Profiles - a way for the user to save and continue their progress by linking
  to user profiles would be a nice feature.
  
- High Scores - Saving the high scores of user would also be a nice feature to have.

- TGA Loader - check if the TGA loader is truncating data by assuming data read is 
  always square (some px X some px).
