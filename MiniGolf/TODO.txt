List of Todo for GnomeEngine v3.0
=================================

- Comments

- Currently the Arrow depicting the direction of motion of the ball is not parallel 
  to the plane, for example on planes with a slope. Also, it would be nice to be 
  able to point the arrow up to set a vertical acceleration on the ball.
  
- There might be more suitable solution to the resolution of gravity along the 
  slope, at the moment the motion down a slope is inducing a slight gitter/bounce 
  along the y-axis.
  
- Falling into the hole is quite a sudden and non-interesting event. The user is 
  just reset to the next hole without any feedback on success or glimpse of score. 
  An animation of the ball falling into the hole would be nice.
  
- At the moment, the collision code is not factoring in if the ball in not moving 
  towards the plane being tested for collision. This creates a bug when the ball, 
  if very close to the wall will have unpredictable movement when a new acceleration 
  is given to it (like it will travel sticking to the wall).
  
- Certain bugs have been successfully replicated when the ball does not correctly score
  even when its clearly in a scoring position. The putting collision detection doesn't 
  always work.
  
- The black circle representing the cup is not drawing on the plane when the tile's 
  normal is not along the Y-axis.
  
- Some bugs have also been found pertaining to the ball sticking to walls. The problem 
  seems to be related to the amount of various forces (stroke power, gravity etc).
  
- Menu buttons for a long menu (like the Hole list) are not placed correctly as there
  is too much data to be organized on very limited window space. UPDATE: The problem 
  seems to be less pronounced in full screen mode due to more screen real estate.
  
- Some of the menus don't yet have textual description (like help, about, etc).

- User Profiles - a way for the user to save and continue their progress by linking
  to user profiles would be a nice feature.
  
- High Scores - Saving the high scores of user would also be a nice feature to have.
